<p> All the lessons range from '0' classes up to all primary, secondary education and even the preperation for the Leaving Certificate as Polish being the main language which counts as a foreign language. We teach Polish and also general knowledge about Poland and have every Saturdays a math class for children who are struggling with it in Irish schools. For about three years we also teach the Polish language as a foreign language and even encourage kids to join along if this is not their first language. We also organize monthly library meetings along with art and crafts classes. There are also speech therapy classes and for three years we also have preschool classes for younger siblings. Each students meets up weekly at a specific organised time where parents would have time to drop them off and work around Irish school times. Classes are not numerous and each child is actively participating and the teacher listeing out to each and everyone. These lessons are more similar to individual tutoring than lessons known from parents. </p>
